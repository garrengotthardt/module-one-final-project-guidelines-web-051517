# NYC Yellow Cab Booking CLI App

## Overview

With NYC Yellow Cab Booking, when a user provides desired pickup and dropoff locations, the app will provide them with:

— the distance they'll be traveling

— the estimated duration of their trip based on current traffic

— the estimated cost of their trip based on the average cost recent trips of a similar distance

Given this estimate, if they'd like to book a ride, they'll be able to do so directly in the app.


## Install Instructions

To install, fork and clone the app and run `ruby bin/run.rb`
